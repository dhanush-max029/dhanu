    <img src="download (5).jpeg" alt="">
    <p>All living things including plants, animals and human beings need water to live and to carry out different cellular activities.

        Have you ever imagined a day without water?  
        
        No, we have not and it is hard to imagine. We all use water for different kinds of day to day activities, such as cleaning, washing, bathing, cooking, drinking and other domestic and industrial uses.
        
        Water is a precious, essential and an abiotic component of the ecosystem. Today we all are heading toward the scarcity of water, and this is mainly because of the lack of water conservation and pollution of water bodies. So, let us not waste a drop of water and start conserving water for further use.
